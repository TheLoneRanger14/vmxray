This file describes how to build TSK using Visual Studio (see README_win32.txt for instructions on building the win32 libraries and executables from Linux).  If you do not have a copy of Visual Studio, you can use the free Express Edition:

    http://www.microsoft.com/express/vc/

The Visual Studio Solution file has three build targets: Debug, Debug_NoLibs, and Release.  Debug and Release require that libewf exist and be compiled (libewf provides support for E01 image files).   Debug_NoLibs does not require libewf and you should be able to compile Debug_NoLibs without any additional setup.

The steps below outline the process required to compile the Debug and Release targets.

1) Download libewf-20091128 or later from:
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/libewf/

2) Open archive file, rename directory from libewf-2009XXXX to libewf, and move the libewf directory to the win32 TSK subdirectory.  For example, the result should be something like: sleuthkit-3.0.0\win32\libewf.

3) Follow the README instructions in libewf to build libewf_dll (at the time of this writing, that includes downloading the zlib dll). Note that TSK will use only the Release version of libewf_dll.

5) Open the TSK Visual Studio Solution file in the win32 directory. 

6) Compile a Debug or Release version of the libraries or executables. 

7) Note that the libraries and executables will depend on the libewf and zlib dll files (which are located in libewf/msvscpp/release  and libewf/msvscpp/zlib).
